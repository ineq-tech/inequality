	\textcite{muirhead_1902} proves a very important result regarding symmetric sums and means. It is widely used for solving problems, specially coupled with some other method such as \hyperref[ch:buffalo]{The Buffalo Way}.
		\begin{theorem}[Murihead's inequality]
			Let $\mathbf{x}$ be a vector of positive real numbers and $\mathbf{a}$ be dominated by $\mathbf{b}$. Then
				\begin{align*}
					\mathfrak{M}[\mathbf{a}](\mathbf{x})
						& \leq \mathfrak{M}[\mathbf{b}](\mathbf{x})
				\end{align*}
		\end{theorem}
	\textcite{paris_vencovska_2009} proves a generalization of this inequality but the result is of little practical use for Olympiad purposes.
