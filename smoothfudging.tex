	\section{Smoothing and Isolated Fudging}\label{sec:smoothfudging}
	In many inequalities of the form
		\begin{align*}
			f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})
				& \geq a
		\end{align*}
	for some real number $a$, we may be able to establish the property that $f$ assumes smaller values when the difference between two variables $x_{i}$ and $x_{j}$ decreases. In such cases, we can use the fact that $f$ assumes the smallest value when $x_{1}=\ldots=x_{n}$. This is known as the \textit{smoothing principle}. Recall that we used a similar argument for arithmetic-geometric mean inequality.
