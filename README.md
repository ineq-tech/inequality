# Techniques in Olympiad Inequalities

This is a book written on Olympiad level inequalities. The purpose is to kill inequalities in popular Olympiads by making some methods of problem solving more popular and well known than they are right now.

Please read the following carefully.
* When referencing a title such as chapter/section or an equation, follow the convention: `\hyperref[label]{text \ref{label}}`
* For referencing a title, the format should be something like this: `\hyperref[ch:subs]{chapter $\S$\ref{ch:subs}}`
  Here a single `\S` means it is a chapter, two `\S` means it is a section and three means it is a subsection. So put them accordingly. We will replace the title words with the     appropriate number of `\S`
* For referencing an equation, do not put any `\S` or `\ddagger` because it will automatically be placed. An example is `\hyperref[eqn:nesbittf]{equation \ref{eqn:nesbittf}}`
* For referencing environments such as theorem/lemma or others, use the typical `\autoref{label}`

This may make us put some extra work into referencing but the output is a lot better this way.
