# Techniques in Olympiad Inequalities

This is a book written on Olympiad level inequalities. The purpose is to kill inequalities in popular Olympiads by making some methods of problem solving more popular and well known than they are right now.

READ
* When referencing an equation, use `\ref{eqn:label}`
* When referencing an environment such as theorem, lemma or problem, use `\nameref{label}` if the environment has a name. That is, if it was in the format
  
    `\begin{env}[Name]\label{env:label}
      \end{env}
     `
 then use `\nameref{env:label}` instead of `\ref{env:label}` or `\autoref{env:label}`. This way, we will print the actual name instead of the number, which is better and more convenient.
* For referencing anything without name such as chapter or section, use `\autoref{label}`. 

I have customized the reference for chapter, section, problem and equations.
* Always use `\sum\limits_` instead of `\sum_`, `\prod\limits_` instead of `\prod_`, etc.
* If you think some other font would look better, consult me first. I have put in a lot of effort for achieving this antique latex style. That's one of the main reasons why I no longer have any motivation to continue this book. So unless I think the font you are recommending is better, I do not intend on changing it. It's unlikely you will find a better font for retaining an old  look considering I have tried out a lot of fonts already.
