# Techniques in Olympiad Inequalities

This is a book written on Olympiad level inequalities. The purpose is to kill inequalities in popular Olympiads by making some methods of problem solving more popular and well known than they are right now.

READ
* When referencing an equation, use `\ref{eqn:label}`
* When referencing a custom environment such as theorem, lemma or problem, use `\nameref{label}` if the environment has a name. That is, if it was in the format
  
    `\begin{env}[Name]\label{env:label}
      \end{env}
     `
 then use `\nameref{env:label}` instead of `\ref{env:label}` or `\autoref{env:label}`. This way, we will print the actual name instead of the number, which is better and more convenient.
* For referencing anything else such as chapter or section, use `\autoref{label}`. 

I have customized the reference for chapter, section, problem and equations.
