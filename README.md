# Techniques in Olympiad Inequalities

This is a book written on Olympiad level inequalities. The purpose is to kill inequalities in popular Olympiads by making some methods of problem solving more popular and well known than they are right now.

Please read the following carefully.
* When referencing a title such as chapter/section, follow the convention: `\hyperref[label]{text \ref{label}}`
* For referencing a title, the format should be something like this: `\hyperref[ch:subs]{$\S$\ref{ch:subs}}`
  Here a single `\S` means it is a chapter, two `\S` means it is a section and three means it is a subsection. So put them accordingly. We will replace the title words with the     appropriate number of `\S`
* For referencing environments such as theorem/lemma or others, use the typical `\autoref{label}`
* For referencing equations, simply use `\ref{label}` Do not use `\autoref` because it will put the word `Equation` in it even though most of them will be inequalities. Omit the word `equation` or `inequality` before refencing it. For that purpose, a dagger symbol will be placed before the equation number. So use `\ref{ineq:extendedmother}` instead of `inequality \ref{ineq:extendedmother}`

This may make us put some extra work into referencing but the output is a lot better this way.
