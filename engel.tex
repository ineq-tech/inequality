	\chapter{Engel Form of Cauchy-Schwarz}\label{ch:engel}
	We mentioned earlier that there is a particular case of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality which is very useful for solving problems. It is known as \textit{Engel form of Cauchy-Schwarz}. Some people also call it \textit{Titu's lemma} or \textit{T2's lemma}. Even though it is a direct consequence of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, it can be proven independently as well. Moreover, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can be proven using this result as well.
