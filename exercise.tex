	\chapter{Practice Problems}\label{ch:practice}
	
	We will pose various types of problems here. The problems will not be sorted in any particular order. There will be no categorization and similar problems will not be put together. We did not provide practice problems per section or chapter because in real contest, you will have no way of knowing what technique or theorem to use. This is why we only demonstrated some problems when we discussed a particular concept but did not put any extra problem with it. Here, you are free to use any method necessary to solve the problems.
